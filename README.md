# Video Diary App

The Video Diary App is designed with simplicity, efficiency, and scalability in mind, following modern React Native development practices. It provides an intuitive and seamless experience for users who want to manage and personalize their video diary entries. The app allows users to:
* Import videos,
* Crop a specific 5-second segment from the video,
* Add custom details such as name and description,
* Save the cropped videos to a personal list for future reference.
